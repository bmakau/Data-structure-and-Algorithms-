# Introduction
In computer science, data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and managing data efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas used for solving computational problems.

This repository serves as a reference and learning resource for understanding and implementing various data structures and algorithms.

# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Our Project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your fellow participants.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

## 6. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team. We will do our best to ensure that all complaints are handled in a manner that is fair and consistent to all parties.

## 7. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues, online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.


# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! 

## Code Formatting and Style Guidelines

Please ensure your code is understandable and well documented to help other learners. Also, make sure the solutions are optimized for time complexity and space. Brute force solutions are still allowed as long is of interest to the community.

## Branch Naming Conventions and Git Workflow

We follow the data structure name-problem summary for example Trie-Search workflow. First letter should be capitalized. Please create a separate branch for your work.

## Testing Requirements and Procedures

Please add tests for any new problem or bug fixes. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request and make you cover all edge cases.

## Documentation Standards and Contribution Guidelines

If you're adding or changing functionality, please update the documentation accordingly.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

When reporting issues, please make sure the issue is not existing issue. Also if you are able to solve the issue please create a branch refer to branch naming conventions.

## Pull Request Submission Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:
- Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.

## Code Review Process and Expectations

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. We will be recommending reviewers depending on their previous contributions and their contribution constistency.

## Code Licensing and Copyright Considerations

Please do not copy other people work and make sure your contribution is not from open source projects or protected intellectual property.

## Happy coding
